# Fetch API for Dog Images - Description

This project is a simple example of using the Fetch API in JavaScript to fetch random dog images from a public API and display them on a web page. The Fetch API is a modern and efficient way to make HTTP requests in JavaScript, making it easy to interact with external services and retrieve data.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to use the Fetch API to interact with a RESTful API and handle the data it returns. In this case, I have utilized the [Dog CEO's Dog API](https://thedogapi.com/) to retrieve random dog images.

## Features

- **Random Dog Images**: The project fetches random dog images from the Dog CEO's Dog API with each button click.

- **Error Handling**: It includes error handling to manage situations where the network request fails, providing a clear error message in the console.

- **Dynamic Display**: The fetched dog image is dynamically displayed on the web page, replacing the previous image with each new request.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Create an HTML file (e.g., `index.html`) and a JavaScript file (e.g., `index.js`) in the same directory.

2. **HTML Structure**: Add the provided HTML structure to your `index.html` file. This structure includes a button to trigger the API request and an empty container to display the fetched dog images.

3. **JavaScript Code**: Add the JavaScript code from `index.js` to your `index.js` file. This code sets up event handling for the button click, makes GET requests to the Dog API, and dynamically displays the fetched dog images.

4. **Run**: Open your `index.html` file in a web browser. Click the "Fetch Random Dog" button to retrieve and display random dog images from the API. Each click replaces the previous image with a new random dog picture.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a practical introduction to using the Fetch API in JavaScript to interact with external APIs.
